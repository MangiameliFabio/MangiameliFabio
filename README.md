## Hi there glad you found my ProfileðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio Mangiameli and currently, I study computer science for media at the HdM in Stuttgart. I love game development and have a passion for programming.
During my studies, I created a few Game Projects which I wanted to share.

### Curse of Immortality 

Curse of Immortality is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which the player must face various challenges in an arena. It was one of my first projects made as a team and an awesome experience. I had a great time working together, discussing coding problems, and having fun. I was responsible for creating the logic of the enemies and helped out with the traps in the arena. I learned much about State Machines and C++ development in Unreal. It was also the first project I was really proud of. Most of the code I wrote you can find [here](https://github.com/Vel0X/CurseOfImmortality/tree/main/Source/CurseOfImmortality/AI). Feel free to also check out the rest of the source code and play our game.

### Crunch Time
Crunch Time was created during the BeansJam 2022. The theme for this game jam was "We have to stay awake" and our game managed to become place 7! <br>
The game is about a company late at night and you are the intern which needs to supply the workers with caffeine-containing drinks. Sometimes even the Sandman is showing up and you need to slap him out of existence. If you want to play it, check it out on [itch.io](https://zwietabak.itch.io/crunch-time). <br>
My main role was programming the player and the sandman. The source code you can find [here](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Crunch_Time).

### Top Down Shooter in custom Engine
With this project I wanted to learn more about the internals of a game engine, and what better way to learn it than just writing your own little engine? I followed the [LazzyFoo SDL tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) to learn more about rendering in SDL and how to implement sounds. With the knowledge of the Game Engine lecture from university and the book [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.de/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582906/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=Ã…MÃ…Å½Ã•Ã‘&crid=3V71KG1U14PUB&keywords=Gameplay+programming+patterns&qid=1680433547&sprefix=gameplay+programming+patterns%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-4) I just started coding. You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Top_Down_Shooter_in_custom_Engine). The project is far away from being finished. I want to implement a UI, sounds, and better gameplay in the future.

### State Machine Generator
For the lecture Engine Programming, we needed to create an addon for Godot. I love using state machines in my code but there's always plenty of boiler code to write which is annoying. So I created this addon which will basically generate template code for GDScript that you can completely modify. You can see this addon in action in the source code of [Crunch Time](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Crunch_Time) or look up the [repository](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/State_Machine_Generator) to find out how to install and use it.
