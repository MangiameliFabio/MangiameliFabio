## Hi there glad you found my ProfileðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio Mangiameli, I currently study computer science for media at the HdM in Stuttgart. I love game development and have a passion for programming.
Have a look at the game projects I did during my studies.

### Duskborn

The game is a third-person shooter rouge-like and was created in Unreal Engine 5.1. With a variety of movement options, you explore the world and upgrade yourself with items until you mangae to beat the final boss.

This game was developed as a project for the game "internship" at HdM. It is supposed to be an experience as close to practice as possible. We were 18 people developing the game split into different departments.

#### Managing

I was head of engineering and led a small team of 3 people. I organized weekly meetings, created tasks and distributed them to the team. I was also responsible for setting up the project and managing a perforce repo. To make sure everyone is on the same page I created tutorials on how to install Perforce and Unreal. All the time I was in close communication with the game design and graphics head and together we formed this project.

#### Coding

Besides managing, I was responsible for the implementation of the player character. The grappling hook mechanic was by far the hardest challenge. We needed a grappling hook which can pull the player towards the grappled direction but also give the option of just hanging on the rope and swinging through the level. I used a state machine which can run two states at the same time. One state is the current movement state and the other one is the current combat state. In the future, the player should have the opportunity to change the prostheses of his character. Although the feature cant be seen in the game right now I implemented a system to make sure this is possible. 

Another task was the implementation of the upgrade system. I created a scheme which showed how the architecture should look and presented it to my colleague. Together we started the implementation. In the game, an item consists of two upgrade parts. One is the effect and the other one is the trigger. For example, an effect could be "spawn missile" and the trigger is "on kill" so the item will spawn a missile every time the player kills an enemy. To archive this I used the observer pattern for the triggers. For the effects, we wanted to have the possibility to create them in blueprints because later a person from game design did the actual implementation of the effects. To create an Item we used a factory.

#### Side Tasks
- implementation of the destructor enemy (big turret)
- enemy health bars
- damage numbers
- missile effect

### Curse of Immortality 

Curse of Immortality is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which the player must face various challenges in an arena. We used Unreal Engine 5.1. 

I was responsible for creating the enemy logic. This was my first contact with the state machine pattern and I used it for all characters. In the game are 6 different types of enemies and all have different behaviour. Especially the final boss which can be seen in the second picture was a nice challenge because of the variety of different attacks. We used custom pathfinding which was implemented by my colleague. I created a heat map for this pathfinding for a more natural-looking pathfinding.

I also helped out with the traps in the arena and integrated them into our damage system.

I learned much about C++ and development in Unreal. Most of the code I wrote you can find [here](https://github.com/Vel0X/CurseOfImmortality/tree/main/Source/CurseOfImmortality/AI). Feel free to also check out the rest of the source code and play our game.

### Crunch Time
Crunch Time was created during the BeansJam 2022. The theme for this game jam was "We have to stay awake" and our game was rated place 7 out of 65 submissions!

The game is about a company late at night and you are the intern who needs to supply the workers with caffeinated drinks. Sometimes even the Sandman shows up and tries to put your coworkers to sleep. So you need to slap him out of existence. Check out our game on [itch.io](https://zwietabak.itch.io/crunch-time).

I implemented the player character. A state machine was maybe a little bit overkill but with the [plugin](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/State_Machine_Generator) I created for Godot I could fast generate the boilerplate code which was perfect because of the short time. The Sandman was implemented similarly by me. I was also responsible for the elevator mechanic and the sound implementation. Also, I helped with the UI implementation.

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Crunch_Time).

### Enchanted Defense
I wanted to learn more about the internals of a game engine, and what better way to learn it than just writing your own little engine? I followed the [LazzyFoo SDL tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) to learn more about rendering in SDL and how to implement sounds. With the knowledge of the Game Engine lecture from university and the book [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.de/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582906/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=Ã…MÃ…Å½Ã•Ã‘&crid=3V71KG1U14PUB&keywords=Gameplay+programming+patterns&qid=1680433547&sprefix=gameplay+programming+patterns%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-4) I started coding. 

The global state of the engine is handled with a singleton. To update all my game objects I created an update loop in which all game objects can click in. For animations, I use sprite sheets. With the possibility of SDL2 to just render a specific part of an image I implemented a method to iterate through the different frames of the animation. With an animation state machine, I switch between animations. For the Game, I use the command pattern in the input management to capsule input handling from the player character. With the observer pattern, I notify the game objects about stuff like the player dying or all inputs handled. To create enemies I used the prototype pattern. 

You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Top_Down_Shooter_in_custom_Engine).

For the gameplay, I was inspired by Stardew Valley's minigame that you play on one of the arcade machines. It is a top-down shooter in which you need to defend yourself against hordes of enemies. The Game is far from being finished. I intend to implement a UI, sounds, and custom data container to not rely on the standard C++ library anymore.

### State Machine Generator
For the lecture Game Engine Programming, we got the task to create an addon for Godot. I love using state machines in my code but there's always plenty of boiler code to write which is annoying. So I created an addon which generates code for GDScript that you can completely modify. The plugin will use template files in which I wrote down the code for a state machine. In GDScript I create strings out of them and replace some placeholders with actual class and object names. With this string, a .gd file is generated which then can be used and modified in Godot.

You can see this addon in action in the source code of [Crunch Time](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/Crunch_Time) or look up the [repository](https://github.com/MangiameliFabio/State_Machine_Generator) to find out how to install and use it.
